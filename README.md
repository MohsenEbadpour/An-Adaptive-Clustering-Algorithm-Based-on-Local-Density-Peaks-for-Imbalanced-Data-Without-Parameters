# An Adaptive Clustering Algorithm Based on Local-Density Peaks for Imbalanced Data Without Parameters

Welcome to the Adaptive Clustering Algorithm repository! This project represents the culmination of my work as part of the Big Data course at Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT) during the Spring 2023 semester. The project revolves around the implementation and extension of the paper titled "An Adaptive Clustering Algorithm Based on Local-Density Peaks for Imbalanced Data Without Parameters."

## Overview

In this repository, I present a comprehensive implementation of the clustering algorithm outlined in the paper. However, my work goes beyond mere replication; I extend and refine the algorithm to address limitations observed in real-world datasets.

## Key Contributions

- **Extension and Implementation**: I have implemented the clustering algorithm described in the paper from the ground up. This includes all the essential components and steps outlined in the paper's architecture.

- **Handling Dataset Noise**: The original algorithm faces challenges when dealing with datasets that contain natural noise or normal (non-imbalanced) data(sample image in report). Recognizing this limitation, I suggest and implement a novel technique that mitigates these issues, allowing the algorithm to perform effectively in a wider range of scenarios.

- **Highest Project Score**: I am proud to announce that this project received the highest score in the final project implementation category and achieved a perfect overall course score of 20/20.

## Tools and Frameworks

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: NumPy
